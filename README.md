# Angry Birds
A clone of original Angry Birds mobile game. 
The player hurls birds or similar objects towards a fortress to destroy enemy targets. Player should use as few throws as possible for the higher score. Fortresses are built of destroyable and non-destroyable construction elements. Failing, i.e not destroying all of the enemies, typically means the level is reset and all points are lost.
